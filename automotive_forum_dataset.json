It was at 85,432 miles before the battery died, but now it's showing 85,401 miles. Is this normal after a battery replacement? The trip meter also reset to zero. Should I be concerned about this 31-mile difference? I've heard that some cars store odometer data in volatile memory. Any advice would be appreciated.",

      "content": "I swapped the gauge faces in my 2017 Mustang GT cluster to white-face gauges for better visibility. The physical swap went fine, but now the cluster shows some warning lights and the odometer display is garbled. I think the cluster needs to be reprogrammed or reset after the modification. What Ford programming procedures are needed after gauge face replacement? Is this something that can be done with FORScan or does it require dealer-level equipment?",
